# Updater and git-update

This new update system allows you to update Igntion form a webserver or from a git repository like github.

## Command line updater
Coming soon

## Updater.sh
!Version 5.0 not complete!

Use version 4.1 if really needed, found in the "Old" folder

Documentation Coming soon

## git-update.sh
Do not place update script in the same directory as Igntion to avoid possible problems.

This bash script can be run using either

#### bash git-update.sh
or
#### bash git-update.sh --nightly

Adding --nightly will update Igntion from the nightly branch stable branch.

You will may need Root access (sudo) if you are updating Igntion from a directory that requires root access.
